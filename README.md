# What is Tau?

Tau is a collection of text animation and text styling components for Framer.

Since Framer components are just React components with Framer property controls, these can be used in any React project as well once you remove Framer-specific imports and canvas property controls.

# Can I use it in my templates/client projects?

Yes. Feel free to use Tau for any commercial or personal projects or use it in your product.

# Anything else?

If you want to help, feel free to star the project here on GitHub, give @teyah.design a shout on social media or open a PR :)
